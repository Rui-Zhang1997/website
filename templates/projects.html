                Royal Bank of Canada API Catalogue (Jun. 2018 - Aug. 2018)
            </div>
            <div class='project-desc'>
                RBCCM has a large number of internal APIs developed by its many teams, from traders to programmers, and there should be a central place where people can search and experiment with the APIs. As such, the 2018 Summer Intern Class was tasked with creating an API Catalogue where RBC developers can onboard their APIs and have it be visible to RBCCM as well as other groups such as Investor and Treasury Services. I worked in a full-stack role, designing and implementing backend and, whenever needed, the frontend as well. Our backend stack consisted of Python 3 and Django with DRF and a SQL database. Our frontend utilized ReactJS to allow for more responsive pages, SASS/SCSS, and TypeScript. In addition, all the were required to write unit tests and perform code reviews before any code is merged into the development branch, which is then checked by JenkinsCI and merged to our mainline. In addition, worked in an Agile environment and we rotated Scrum Master duties every sprint amongst the team members.

            <div class='subsection-name bold'> Rutgers Android Application (Jan. 2017 - Now) </div>
            <div class='project-desc'>
                This is my primary and ongoing responsibility at work: the development and maintenance of the mobile application for our University. 
                The purpose of the application is so that the University can deliver information to its students, faculty, and all who is concerned
                in a timely and efficient manner. This includes everything from class availability to the arrival and transit times of the University's Bus System
                to what is showing at the campus cinema. We provide this infomration to 20,000+ users everyday. As the primary developer, I have
                implemented major changes and additions to the application. These include a complete overhaul of the Schedule of Classes, Bus Tracking Module, Cinema
                Module, among others. In addition, I also resolve any bugs relating to the application. Our primary libraries is Android, RxJava, and Retrofit.

            <div class='subsection-name bold'> Rutgers Mobile Backend (Mar. 2017 - Now) </div>
            This is the backend that the mobile applications relies on. Because we rely on many APIs from different sources, whether from within Rutgers or otherwise,
            we have to be able to account for different data transmission formats, rapid API changes, and large datasets. It would be very difficult to do all of this
            on the client and therefore the server was created. It was built using the Express.js framework with MariaDB as our database. I started working on it in
            March, 2017 and since August its development has rested solely upon me.

            <div class='subsection-name bold'> Photoanalyser (Jan. 2018) </div>
            I went on a trip to California, traveling to such places as Big Sur National Park and the Grand Canyon. However, I took too many photos, many of them of the
            same scene. Therefore, it would be a pain to sort all of these out. I remembered reading somewhere that using FFTs one can determine
            the blurriness of an image and I thought I would build a tool that would be able to discern between the good photographs and those that are too shaky to keep.
            Even though it probably would have taken less time to simply look through the photographs myself and choose the good ones, using a week to write this program
            taught me about FFTs, signal processing, and various libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. I wrote this in Python 3.

            <div class='subsection-name bold'> HackRU Ideaboard (Sept. 2017 - Nov. 2017) </div>
            The primary goal of a hackathon is working on a team to solve a particular problem. But unless one comes with a team in mind, finding that team might be
            difficult. I helped to build the Ideaboard for HackRU, which is meant to help HackRU attendees form groups. Ideaboard is a Slackbot that allows attendees
            to list their project ideas and see the ideas of others, so that everyone could see if there is any project that interests them. So instead of having to
            ask around and potentially miss the chance to help on a project that one likes, one can just use the Ideaboard, see all the projects that are recruiting
            and what skills the project requires, and sign on with them.

        <div class='subsection project-subsection'>
            <div class='subsection-name bold'> ProtoPy (Oct. 2016) </div>
            A Hackathon project for HackRU 2016. My team and I were inspired by Scratch, a tool developed specifically to introduce programming concepts and
            ideas. Scratch uses flow-diagrams to allow learners to learn the concepts without having to worry about language-specific things such as syntax.
            However, we wanted to do something similar but allow these flow-diagrams to be of actual use to its users. Therefore, we needed to convert the
            flow-diagrams into an actaul, readable programming language. We decided on Python for its simplicity. The language has several other advantages, including
            its ease of readability, so that the users can learn to read the program without much training, as well as its widespread adoption by the industry. Thus,
            instead of creating something only that learners can run from inside Scratch, we made it so that the users can see the real-world impact of their
            efforts.
