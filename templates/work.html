            <p class='subsection-name bold'> Summer Technical Analyst @ Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Capital Markets (Jun. 2018 - Aug. 2018) </p> <p> RBC Capital Markets (RBCCM) offers investment and finance services to corporations and is the only part of RBC that operates within the United States. In an effort to adapt to a rapidly changing market and stay ahead of the curve, RBCCM is heavily dependent on technology and as such has hundreds of various internal apis and libraries that are used by RBCCM as well as other parts of RBC such as Investor and Treasury Services (I&TS). As such, the 2018 Intern Group was tasked with building a centralized API Catalogue in order to provide a central repository of existing APIs and its documentation. We worked in a Scrum environment that helped us to meet deadlines and deliverables through two-week sprints. At the end of our sprints, we were tasked with presenting our results to upper management. </p>
